# Paint By Number
A pixel art paint by number game was made in Godot.
The goal of creating the project was the ability to make a "Paint by Number" game from any picture just by providing a picture file. So, all you need to do to use the project is just to set the texture field of Scenario.gd script with an image resource. See Scenario.gd for an example.
